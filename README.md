Overall, in this assessment I have used my data analysis skills on SQL and finding out a selection of names combined with other datas. 
I feel confident when it comes to data analysis, but when it comes to selecting data types I sometimes get it incorrect.
Date/Time as DATE did not work as a data type for me for some reason so I selected it as a VARCHAR instead. 
I then used wildcards instead to find the answer.
Selecting Primary keys was also straight forward, but for some foreign keys it somehow did not work for me aswell.
